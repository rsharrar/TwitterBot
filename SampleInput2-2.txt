Donald
Trump
is
betting
his
reelection
on
convincing
most
Americans
that
the
“chaos
president”
can
deliver
order.

“Chaos
president”
is
how
former
Florida
Governor
Jeb
Bush
described
Trump
in
the
final
Republican
presidential-primary
debate
of
2015.
Bush’s
argument
against
Trump’s
erratic
leadership
style
didn’t
save
his
flagging
campaign,
but
his
coinage
may
have
been
the
single
most
accurate
forecast
of
Trump’s
turbulent
tenure.
Trump’s
presidency
has
been
marked
by
constant
turnover
in
personnel,
hairpin
turns
in
policy,
angry
feuds
with
politicians
in
both
parties,
perpetual
Twitter
wars,
the
disregard
and
disparaging
of
experts,
a
torrent
of
lies
and
misrepresentations,
and
the
most
open
appeals
to
white
racial
resentment
of
any
other
national
figure
since
George
Wallace.

All
that
history
looms
over
Trump
as
the
coronavirus
pandemic,
the
accompanying
economic
collapse,
and
nationwide
protests
and
unrest
over
racial
inequity
have
left
millions
of
Americans
uneasy.
Trump
is
trying
to
overcome
Joe
Biden’s
consistent
lead
in
the
polls
by
presenting
himself
as
the
leader
to
restore
calm
to
the
streets
and
normalcy
to
the
economy.
But
the
volatility
that
has
infused
each
day
of
his
presidency
hugely
complicates
his
effort
to
convince
Americans
that
he
can
stabilize
their
lives.

“These
are
problems
that
are
not
friendly
to
Trump’s
management
style,”
says
Donald
Kettl,
a
federal-management
expert
at
the
University
of
Texas
at
Austin.
When
it
comes
to
both
the
virus
and
the
unrest,
“the
great
risk
is
that
he
could
increasingly
lose
control
of
the
definition
of
the
problem,
seem
increasingly
out
of
synch
on
the
solutions,
and
fail
to
develop
confidence
he
knows
where
it
is
he
wants
to
go.”

The
biggest
problem
with
Trump
running
on
restoring
order
is
that
his
performance
in
office
has
caused
many
voters
to
view
him
as
the
candidate
of
disorder.
In
a
Yahoo/YouGov
national
survey
conducted
immediately
after
the
Republican
National
Convention
last
week,
only
30
percent
of
registered
voters
said
they
believe
that
Trump
“will
protect
us
from
the
chaos”;
fully
50
percent
described
him
as
the
“source
of
the
chaos.”

One
major
reason
for
that
verdict:
Trump
has
not
adjusted
his
combative
and
impulsive
leadership
style
to
respond
to
the
twin
crises
roiling
the
nation.
That
chaotic
approach
always
alienated
some
voters,
but
its
consequences
have
become
more
tangible
and
visceral
when
applied
to
both
the
outbreak
and
the
protests.

“Trump’s
great
success
has
been
to
define
big
problems
as
political
symbols,”
Kettl
told
me.
“But
the
problem
with
the
virus
is
portraying
it
as
a
political
symbol
runs
afoul
of
people
lying
in
intensive-care
units.
You
can’t
just
portray
it
as
a
symbol
when
there
is
a
ferocious
reality
staring
people
in
the
face
…
The
same
is
true
on
the
economy,
and
the
same
is
true
on
the
issue
of
race.”

Trump
has
worked
to
fit
these
challenges
into
his
preexisting
framework
of
conservative
populism,
which
targets
“elites”
and
racial
minorities.
He’s
long
framed
the
outbreak
as
a
kind
of
culture
war
by
disparaging
expert
advice;
attacking
state
and
local
Democratic
officials
(especially
when
the
outbreak
was
mainly
in
blue
states);
supporting
protesters,
some
of
them
carrying
Confederate
flags
and
automatic
weapons,
who
have
demanded
that
Democratic
governors
end
lockdowns;
and
signaling
disdain
for
mask
wearing
and
social
distancing
meant
to
slow
the
disease’s
spread.
This
campaign
reached
its
apogee
at
last
week’s
RNC,
when
speakers
repeatedly
talked
about
the
outbreak
in
the
past
tense—even
as
about
6,000
Americans
died
during
the
week
that
the
proceedings
unfolded—and
Trump
capped
the
gathering
with
a
huge,
crowded
in-person
rally
on
the
White
House’s
South
Lawn.

“The
biggest
problem
Trump
has
is
that
voters
are
tired
of
hearing
from
him,
especially
when
he
said
everything
is
fine
on
coronavirus,”
says
one
GOP
pollster,
who
spoke
with
me
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
to
discuss
the
race’s
dynamics.
“It’s
not
...
[The
pandemic
is]
interfering,
in
his
mind,
with
his
economy,
that
he
built,
and
so
he’s
got
to
downplay
it.
He
is
a
developer,
so
his
reaction
is
to
promise
everything.
If
people
see
a
problem,
say,
‘Oh
no,
that’s
not
a
problem—it’s
going
to
go
down
to
zero.’
This
is
just
how
he
deals
with
stuff.
It
could
end
up
costing
him
the
White
House.”

On
the
civil
unrest,
after
some
initial
expressions
of
concern
about
police
misconduct
immediately
following
George
Floyd’s
killing,
Trump
has
turned
almost
entirely
toward
confrontation
with
the
protest
movement.
He
has
derided
Black
Lives
Matter
demonstrators
and
local
Democratic
officials
with
inflammatory
accusations
and
has
downplayed
concerns
about
police
shootings.
In
an
interview
with
Fox
News’s
Laura
Ingraham
this
week,
he
even
likened
police
who
shoot
Black
men
to
golfers
who
“choke”
on
a
short
putt.
At
the
same
time,
he’s
repeatedly
refused
to
condemn
vigilante
violence
from
his
own
supporters
in
Kenosha,
Wisconsin,
and
Portland,
Oregon—a
choice
that
extremism
experts
say
amounts
to
an
open
invitation
for
more
of
it.

“Absolutely
he
has
legitimized
it
at
this
point,”
says
Elizabeth
Neumann,
a
former
assistant
secretary
for
threat
prevention
at
Trump’s
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
who
has
endorsed
Biden.
“I
have
to
think
that,
yes,
we’re
probably
going
to
see
more
of
that.”

Trump’s
relentless
attacks
against
Black
Lives
Matter
protesters
the
past
few
weeks
have
unnerved
many
Democrats,
who
fear
he
could
peel
away
some
older
and
blue-collar
white
voters
now
tilting
toward
Biden.
Although
most
national
polls
released
since
the
GOP
convention
still
show
Biden
holding
a
substantial
lead,
a
Monmouth
University
survey
showing
a
tighter
race
in
the
crucial
battleground
state
of
Pennsylvania
sent
shivers
through
anxious
Democrats
yesterday.

Craig
Robinson,
the
former
political
director
of
the
Iowa
Republican
Party
and
the
founder
of
The
Iowa
Republican,
an
online
publication,
says
he
believes
that
Trump’s
warnings
about
unrest
are
resonating,
even
in
a
state
that
has
seen
little
of
it.
“I
think
in
being
the
‘law
and
order’
candidate,
there
are
more
advantages
than
in
trying
to
carve
out
this
nuanced
position”
between
the
protesters
and
the
police.

Yet
it’s
far
from
clear
that
Trump
can
persuade
Americans
to
focus
on
just
one
source
of
this
year’s
disorder—police
killings
and
the
subsequent
protests—rather
the
other
big
disruptor
of
American
life,
the
pandemic.
Citizens
experience
the
street
protests
mostly
on
television,
whereas
the
coronavirus
and
economic
crises
have
unsettled
people’s
daily
lives
much
more
intimately.

“For
99.99
percent
of
Americans,
[civil
unrest]
is
not
a
problem
in
their
life,”
says
Stuart
Stevens,
the
chief
strategist
for
Mitt
Romney’s
2012
presidential
campaign
and
an
adviser
to
the
Lincoln
Project,
a
group
of
Republicans
who
oppose
Trump.
“I
just
think
that
what’s
going
on
in
your
living
room
is
going
to
be
more
vital
to
you
than
what
is
[happening
on]
television
in
some
distant
city.”

In
the
Yahoo/YouGov
national
poll,
just
7
percent
of
registered
voters
said
they
were
very
worried
that
violence
would
break
out
in
their
community;
almost
two-thirds
said
they
were
not
worried
much,
or
at
all.
In
a
Reuters/Ipsos
poll
released
yesterday,
more
than
three-fifths
of
registered
voters
said
crime
was
not
increasing
in
their
community.



And
even
if
Trump
shifts
more
Americans’
focus
from
the
pandemic
to
the
protests,
it’s
uncertain
that
enough
voters
will
believe
he’s
better
suited
than
Biden
to
address
them.
That’s
a
key
difference
from
Richard
Nixon,
whose
1968
law-and-order
campaign
has
inspired
Trump’s
offensive
this
summer.
Although
most
Americans
may
have
believed
that
Nixon
could
deliver
order,
many
now
say
that
Trump’s
confrontational
approach
on
racial
issues
increases
the
risk
of
violence.
In
the
Yahoo/YouGov
poll,
a
solid
56
percent
of
registered
voters
said
they
expected
more
violence
if
Trump
is
reelected,
while
only
24
percent
anticipated
less.
In
a
national
Quinnipiac
University
poll
released
yesterday,
a
50
percent
majority
of
Americans
said
that
having
Trump
as
president
makes
them
feel
less
safe,
rather
than
more.
“He’s
highlighted
the
issue
...
but
it
is
quite
plausible
that
it
doesn’t
break
for
him,
because
he
doesn’t
have
an
answer
to
this
that
brings
more
stability,”
the
Democratic
pollster
Stanley
B.
Greenberg
told
me.

Most
Democrats
I’ve
spoken
with
are
confident
that
Trump’s
iron-fist
response
to
civil
unrest
is
misreading
the
public
mood:
In
their
view,
most
Americans
want
to
calm
dissent,
not
crush
it.
Matt
McDermott,
a
Democratic
pollster,
notes
that
although
most
Americans
have
positive
perceptions
of
the
police,
a
significant
majority
also
agree
that
law-enforcement
bias
against
Black
Americans
is
a
serious
problem.
“The
voting
population
is
saying
that
there
is
something
wrong
here
and
something
needs
to
be
done
to
address
it,”
he
says.
Although
surveys
do
show
growing
concern
about
violence
at
protests,
and
several
point
to
eroding
white
support
for
the
Black
Lives
Matter
movement,
recent
polling
by
the
nonpartisan
Public
Religion
Research
Institute
still
found
that
56
percent
of
Americans
consider
police
shootings
of
Black
men
part
of
a
pattern—a
huge
change
from
2015,
when
a
majority
described
them
as
isolated
incidents.

But
as
he
has
on
so
many
other
issues,
Trump
is
campaigning
in
blunt,
culture-war
terms,
framing
only
the
protests
as
the
problem.
Neumann
says
that
Trump’s
approach
of
drawing
bright
lines
between
allies
and
enemies
virtually
ensures
an
extended
cycle
of
confrontation
over
racial
inequity.
The
continuing
conflict,
she
says,
is
partly
“because
of
the
president’s
inability
to
facilitate
the
kind
of
conversation
that’s
necessary
to
address
the
very
real
issue
that
came
up
after
the
murder
of
George
Floyd:
that
we
have
a
serious
problem
of
racial
injustice
in
our
country,
particularly
within
policing.

“That
requires
leadership
at
the
top
saying,
‘Calm
down
and
listen
to
somebody
else’s
perspective,’”
Neumann
continues.
“He
does
the
opposite,
creating
fear
and
[suggesting
that]
you
better
go
protect
yourself
because
your
mayor
is
not
going
to
do
it.”

Over
nearly
four
years,
Trump
has
demonstrated
that
there
is
a
stable
and
substantial
audience
for
that
approach,
especially
within
his
core
constituencies
of
non-college-educated,
evangelical,
and
rural
white
voters
uneasy
with
the
demographic
changes
remaking
America.
Political
strategists
in
both
parties
whom
I’ve
spoken
with
believe
that
Trump’s
tough
line
on
the
protests
and
his
dismissive
attitude
toward
the
coronavirus
are
aimed
less
at
persuading
ambivalent
voters
than
inspiring
more
of
the
nonvoters
in
his
core
groups
to
flood
the
polls
in
November.
“Everything
he’s
done
is
about
mining
that
one
vein,”
says
Rahm
Emanuel,
the
former
Chicago
mayor
and
former
White
House
chief
of
staff
for
Barack
Obama.

Yet
the
polarizing
leadership
style
that
thrills
Trump’s
core
voters
on
other
issues
may
carry
a
heavier
cost
for
him
on
the
virus
and
nationwide
protests.
The
last
circle
of
voters
who
stand
between
Trump
and
a
second
term
may
not
be
the
Americans
who
are
offended
by
his
ideology,
but
those
who
are
simply
exhausted
by
the
chaos
surrounding
his
presidency,
particularly
in
regard
to
these
two
titanic
challenges.
“I
think
people
don’t
want
racial
unrest
in
the
streets
and
they
don’t
want
COVID,”
Robinson
says.
“They
just
want
to
get
to
2021
and
hope
that
things
are
better.”
