When
President
Donald
Trump
canceled
a
visit
to
the
Aisne-Marne
American
Cemetery
near
Paris
in
2018,
he
blamed
rain
for
the
last-minute
decision,
saying
that
“the
helicopter
couldn’t
fly”
and
that
the
Secret
Service
wouldn’t
drive
him
there.
Neither
claim
was
true.

Trump
rejected
the
idea
of
the
visit
because
he
feared
his
hair
would
become
disheveled
in
the
rain,
and
because
he
did
not
believe
it
important
to
honor
American
war
dead,
according
to
four
people
with
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
discussion
that
day.
In
a
conversation
with
senior
staff
members
on
the
morning
of
the
scheduled
visit,
Trump
said,
“Why
should
I
go
to
that
cemetery?
It’s
filled
with
losers.”
In
a
separate
conversation
on
the
same
trip,
Trump
referred
to
the
more
than
1,800
marines
who
lost
their
lives
at
Belleau
Wood
as
“suckers”
for
getting
killed.

Belleau
Wood
is
a
consequential
battle
in
American
history,
and
the
ground
on
which
it
was
fought
is
venerated
by
the
Marine
Corps.
America
and
its
allies
stopped
the
German
advance
toward
Paris
there
in
the
spring
of
1918.
But
Trump,
on
that
same
trip,
asked
aides,
“Who
were
the
good
guys
in
this
war?”
He
also
said
that
he
didn’t
understand
why
the
United
States
would
intervene
on
the
side
of
the
Allies.

Trump’s
understanding
of
concepts
such
as
patriotism,
service,
and
sacrifice
has
interested
me
since
he
expressed
contempt
for
the
war
record
of
the
late
Senator
John
McCain,
who
spent
more
than
five
years
as
a
prisoner
of
the
North
Vietnamese.
“He’s
not
a
war
hero,”
Trump
said
in
2015
while
running
for
the
Republican
nomination
for
president.
“I
like
people
who
weren’t
captured.”

There
was
no
precedent
in
American
politics
for
the
expression
of
this
sort
of
contempt,
but
the
performatively
patriotic
Trump
did
no
damage
to
his
candidacy
by
attacking
McCain
in
this
manner.
Nor
did
he
set
his
campaign
back
by
attacking
the
parents
of
Humayun
Khan,
an
Army
captain
who
was
killed
in
Iraq
in
2004.

Trump
remained
fixated
on
McCain,
one
of
the
few
prominent
Republicans
to
continue
criticizing
him
after
he
won
the
nomination.
When
McCain
died,
in
August
2018,
Trump
told
his
senior
staff,
according
to
three
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
this
event,
“We’re
not
going
to
support
that
loser’s
funeral,”
and
he
became
furious,
according
to
witnesses,
when
he
saw
flags
lowered
to
half-staff.
“What
the
fuck
are
we
doing
that
for?
Guy
was
a
fucking
loser,”
the
president
told
aides.
Trump
was
not
invited
to
McCain’s
funeral.
(These
sources,
and
others
quoted
in
this
article,
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity.
The
White
House
did
not
return
earlier
calls
for
comment,
but
Alyssa
Farah,
a
White
House
spokesperson,
emailed
me
this
statement
shortly
after
this
story
was
posted:
“This
report
is
false.
President
Trump
holds
the
military
in
the
highest
regard.
He’s
demonstrated
his
commitment
to
them
at
every
turn:
delivering
on
his
promise
to
give
our
troops
a
much
needed
pay
raise,
increasing
military
spending,
signing
critical
veterans
reforms,
and
supporting
military
spouses.
This
has
no
basis
in
fact.”)

Trump’s
understanding
of
heroism
has
not
evolved
since
he
became
president.
According
to
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
president’s
views,
he
seems
to
genuinely
not
understand
why
Americans
treat
former
prisoners
of
war
with
respect.
Nor
does
he
understand
why
pilots
who
are
shot
down
in
combat
are
honored
by
the
military.
On
at
least
two
occasions
since
becoming
president,
according
to
three
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
his
views,
Trump
referred
to
former
President
George
H.
W.
Bush
as
a
“loser”
for
being
shot
down
by
the
Japanese
as
a
Navy
pilot
in
World
War
II.
(Bush
escaped
capture,
but
eight
other
men
shot
down
during
the
same
mission
were
caught,
tortured,
and
executed
by
Japanese
soldiers.)

When
lashing
out
at
critics,
Trump
often
reaches
for
illogical
and
corrosive
insults,
and
members
of
the
Bush
family
have
publicly
opposed
him.
But
his
cynicism
about
service
and
heroism
extends
even
to
the
World
War
I
dead
buried
outside
Paris—people
who
were
killed
more
than
a
quarter
century
before
he
was
born.
Trump
finds
the
notion
of
military
service
difficult
to
understand,
and
the
idea
of
volunteering
to
serve
especially
incomprehensible.
(The
president
did
not
serve
in
the
military;
he
received
a
medical
deferment
from
the
draft
during
the
Vietnam
War
because
of
the
alleged
presence
of
bone
spurs
in
his
feet.
In
the
1990s,
Trump
said
his
efforts
to
avoid
contracting
sexually
transmitted
diseases
constituted
his
“personal
Vietnam.”)

On
Memorial
Day
2017,
Trump
visited
Arlington
National
Cemetery,
a
short
drive
from
the
White
House.
He
was
accompanied
on
this
visit
by
John
Kelly,
who
was
then
the
secretary
of
homeland
security,
and
who
would,
a
short
time
later,
be
named
the
White
House
chief
of
staff.
The
two
men
were
set
to
visit
Section
60,
the
14-acre
area
of
the
cemetery
that
is
the
burial
ground
for
those
killed
in
America’s
most
recent
wars.
Kelly’s
son
Robert
is
buried
in
Section
60.
A
first
lieutenant
in
the
Marine
Corps,
Robert
Kelly
was
killed
in
2010
in
Afghanistan.
He
was
29.
Trump
was
meant,
on
this
visit,
to
join
John
Kelly
in
paying
respects
at
his
son’s
grave,
and
to
comfort
the
families
of
other
fallen
service
members.
But
according
to
sources
with
knowledge
of
this
visit,
Trump,
while
standing
by
Robert
Kelly’s
grave,
turned
directly
to
his
father
and
said,
“I
don’t
get
it.
What
was
in
it
for
them?”
Kelly
(who
declined
to
comment
for
this
story)
initially
believed,
people
close
to
him
said,
that
Trump
was
making
a
ham-handed
reference
to
the
selflessness
of
America’s
all-volunteer
force.
But
later
he
came
to
realize
that
Trump
simply
does
not
understand
non-transactional
life
choices.

“He
can’t
fathom
the
idea
of
doing
something
for
someone
other
than
himself,”
one
of
Kelly’s
friends,
a
retired
four-star
general,
told
me.
“He
just
thinks
that
anyone
who
does
anything
when
there’s
no
direct
personal
gain
to
be
had
is
a
sucker.
There’s
no
money
in
serving
the
nation.”
Kelly’s
friend
went
on
to
say,
“Trump
can’t
imagine
anyone
else’s
pain.
That’s
why
he
would
say
this
to
the
father
of
a
fallen
marine
on
Memorial
Day
in
the
cemetery
where
he’s
buried.”

I’ve
asked
numerous
general
officers
over
the
past
year
for
their
analysis
of
Trump’s
seeming
contempt
for
military
service.
They
offer
a
number
of
explanations.
Some
of
his
cynicism
is
rooted
in
frustration,
they
say.
Trump,
unlike
previous
presidents,
tends
to
believe
that
the
military,
like
other
departments
of
the
federal
government,
is
beholden
only
to
him,
and
not
the
Constitution.
Many
senior
officers
have
expressed
worry
about
Trump’s
understanding
of
the
rules
governing
the
use
of
the
armed
forces.
This
issue
came
to
a
head
in
early
June,
during
demonstrations
in
Washington,
D.C.,
in
response
to
police
killings
of
Black
people.
James
Mattis,
the
retired
Marine
general
and
former
secretary
of
defense,
lambasted
Trump
at
the
time
for
ordering
law-enforcement
officers
to
forcibly
clear
protesters
from
Lafayette
Square,
and
for
using
soldiers
as
props:
“When
I
joined
the
military,
some
50
years
ago,
I
swore
an
oath
to
support
and
defend
the
Constitution,”
Mattis
wrote.
“Never
did
I
dream
that
troops
taking
that
same
oath
would
be
ordered
under
any
circumstance
to
violate
the
Constitutional
rights
of
their
fellow
citizens—much
less
to
provide
a
bizarre
photo
op
for
the
elected
commander-in-chief,
with
military
leadership
standing
alongside.”

Another
explanation
is
more
quotidian,
and
aligns
with
a
broader
understanding
of
Trump’s
material-focused
worldview.
The
president
believes
that
nothing
is
worth
doing
without
the
promise
of
monetary
payback,
and
that
talented
people
who
don’t
pursue
riches
are
“losers.”
(According
to
eyewitnesses,
after
a
White
House
briefing
given
by
the
then-chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff,
General
Joe
Dunford,
Trump
turned
to
aides
and
said,
“That
guy
is
smart.
Why
did
he
join
the
military?”)

Yet
another,
related,
explanation
concerns
what
appears
to
be
Trump’s
pathological
fear
of
appearing
to
look
like
a
“sucker”
himself.
His
capacious
definition
of
sucker
includes
those
who
lose
their
lives
in
service
to
their
country,
as
well
as
those
who
are
taken
prisoner,
or
are
wounded
in
battle.
“He
has
a
lot
of
fear,”
one
officer
with
firsthand
knowledge
of
Trump’s
views
said.
“He
doesn’t
see
the
heroism
in
fighting.”
Several
observers
told
me
that
Trump
is
deeply
anxious
about
dying
or
being
disfigured,
and
this
worry
manifests
itself
as
disgust
for
those
who
have
suffered.
Trump
recently
claimed
that
he
has
received
the
bodies
of
slain
service
members
“many,
many”
times,
but
in
fact
he
has
traveled
to
Dover
Air
Force
Base,
the
transfer
point
for
the
remains
of
fallen
service
members,
only
four
times
since
becoming
president.
In
another
incident,
Trump
falsely
claimed
that
he
had
called
“virtually
all”
of
the
families
of
service
members
who
had
died
during
his
term,
then
began
rush-shipping
condolence
letters
when
families
said
the
president
was
not
telling
the
truth.

Trump
has
been,
for
the
duration
of
his
presidency,
fixated
on
staging
military
parades,
but
only
of
a
certain
sort.
In
a
2018
White
House
planning
meeting
for
such
an
event,
Trump
asked
his
staff
not
to
include
wounded
veterans,
on
grounds
that
spectators
would
feel
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
of
amputees.
“Nobody
wants
to
see
that,”
he
said.
